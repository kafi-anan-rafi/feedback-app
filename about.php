<h2>About</h2>
<p class="text-center">When I was in 12th grade at Birshreshtha Munshi Abdur Rouf Public College, I felt interest in Computer Programming and decided to be a Software Engineer. Now I am studying my dream subject at one of the prestigious engineering universities in Bangladesh. <br>

  Besides my study, I have a huge interest in different fields like Graphic Design, Video Editing, 3D Animation, Filmmaking. So, I learnt Graphic Design, Video Editing, Filmmaking and some basic 3D stuff by myself. I hope one day(very soon) I will Travel the world and make videos about it. <br>

  I'm also interested in reading. And I love reading books a lot. I'm reading books about Personal Development, Personal Finance, Share Market, Investing and so on. I'm a life time learner. <br>

  The most important thing is to me that I am a Programmer. I am learning Full Stack Development and interested in Artificial Intelligent. And I enjoy learning every step of it. <br>

  I have a plan to start a YouTube channel and teach programming and digital skills. <br>

  I also have an Entrepreneurial mindset and learning about leadership and business.</p>
